Text-TemplateLite

Text::TemplateLite is a pure-Perl template system intended primarily
for "string-sized" templating (e.g. for message localization rather
than entire "pages") using compact (terse?) templates with a
(relatively) simple syntax.

It is anticipated that templates may (at least sometimes) be entered or
managed by users whose skill set does not include "Perl programmer"
(perhaps a web site administrator, translator, or non-Perl programmer).

Basic length and execution limits provide a measure of protection
against accidental or malicious time- and/or space-based resource
attacks. These are managed by the rendering companion class,
Text::TemplateLite::Renderer.

By design, only basic functionality is included in this module. Use
parts or all of the Text::TemplateLite::Standard function library
and/or create your own custom library to extend its capabilities.


ABOUT THE MODULE NAME

You can legitimately argue that Text::TemplateLite violates at least
the spirit of the "avoid Simple, Easy, Reduced, Tiny, Fast, Small,
Super, Hyper" rule.

However, it does reflect several key design goals (without suggesting
that the module's application is limited only to, e.g., message
localization):

- Light-weight syntax:
  Bare-bones syntax to minimize the learning curve for non-(Perl)-
  programmers (it has only code entrance/exit, comments, literals,
  variables, and calls)

- Light-weight templates:
  Templates compact enough that computed localizations for short messages
  still have a chance to fit in small database fields

- Light-weight resource usage:
  Limitable resource usage (to prevent time- or space-based resource
  attacks)
